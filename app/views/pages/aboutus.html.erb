<p>
	The <%= link_to "Knights of Columbus", "http://kofc.org"%> is the world's largest Catholic fraternal service organization. It was founded by the Venerable Father Michael J. McGivney in New Haven, Connecticut in 1882, and named in honor of Christopher Columbus. Originally serving as a mutual benefit society to low-income immigrant Catholics, it developed into a fraternal service organization dedicated to providing charitable services, promoting Catholic education and actively defending Catholicism in various nations. There are more than 1.8 million members in 15,000 councils, with nearly 200 councils on college campuses.
