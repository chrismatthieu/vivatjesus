	Council meetings occur on the first Thursday of each month at 7:00 PM in rooms 5 and 6 at Corpus Christi. They are 1 hour to discuss busines items and 1 hour for social gathering. All knights are encouraged to attend at least 3 meetings a year.
	There are many activities that occur throughout the year for the Corpus Christi Council including Pancake Breakfast, Golf Tournament, and PIDD just to name a few. Monies raised from these events help the local community.

			Thanks to the efforts of Father Michael J. McGivney, assistant pastor of St. Mary’s Church in New Haven and some of his parishioners, the Connecticut state legislature on March 29, 1882, officially chartered the Knights of Columbus as a fraternal benefit society. The Order is still true to its founding principles of charity, unity and fraternity.

McGivney, whose cause for sainthood is being investigated by the Vatican, brought about what has become the world\'s foremost Catholic fraternal benefit society. The Order has helped families obtain economic security and stability through its life insurance, annuity and long-term care programs, and has contributed time and energy worldwide to service in communities.
